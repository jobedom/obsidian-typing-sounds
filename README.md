# Obsidian Typing Sounds

A simple plugin for those who usually fight themselves to avoid editing while writing.

Hemingway mode will disable all keys that are involved in editing (cursor movement, backspace, cut shortcut, etc.) and will only allow adding text at the end of the current note.

The plugin adds a command `Hemingway Mode: Toggle active` which you can assign to a shortcut, to a button (using something like Commander) or you can just run using the command palette.

## Install

You can follow one of the following methods:

- Install from the community plugin registry under the name `Hemingway Mode`.
- Install using [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) with repository `jobedom/obsidian-hemingway-mode`
- Install manually by copying the release files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-hemingway-mode` in your vault.

Enjoy your writing!
