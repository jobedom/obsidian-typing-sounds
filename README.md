# Typing sounds

Get typewriter sounds when you type.

The plugin adds several commands which you can assign to shortcuts, to buttons (using something like Commander) or you can just run using the command palette.

* `Typing sounds: Toggle typing sounds`
* `Typing sounds: Mute typing sounds`
* `Typing sounds: Unmute typing sounds`
* `Typing sounds: Volume up typing sounds`
* `Typing sounds: Volume down typing sounds`

In the settings page you can mute/unmute and set the volume.

## Install

You can follow one of the following methods:

* Install from the community plugin registry under the name `Typing sounds`.
* Install using [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) with repository `jobedom/obsidian-typing-sounds`
* Install manually by copying the release files (`main.js` and `manifest.json`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-typing-sounds` in your vault, and the three WAV files (`key.wav`, `space.wav` and `enter.wav`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-typing-sounds/sounds`.
