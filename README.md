# Obsidian Typing sounds

Get typewriter sounds when you type into Obsidian.

The plugin adds a command `Typing sounds: Toggle mute typing sounds` which you can assign to a shortcut, to a button (using something like Commander) or you can just run using the command palette.

In the settings page you can mute/unmute and set the volume for the typewriter sounds.

## Install

You can follow one of the following methods:

- Install from the community plugin registry under the name `Typing sounds`.
- Install using [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) with repository `jobedom/obsidian-typing-sounds`
- Install manually by copying the release files (`main.js` and `manifest.json`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-typing-sounds` in your vault, and the two WAV files (`key.wav` and `enter.wav`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-typing-sounds/sounds`.

Enjoy your writing!
